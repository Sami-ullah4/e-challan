            History of E-Challan in Pakistan
          </h2>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-700">
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            In the past, the concept of E-Challan was almost unknown to the
            people of Pakistan. Internet usage was limited, and online banking
            was primarily confined to corporations and commercial entities. Due
            to the lack of technological advancement and digital literacy, most
            citizens were unfamiliar with electronic systems. Government
            institutions also faced challenges such as scarce digital data,
            outdated processes, and a shortage of trained personnel capable of
            implementing such modern infrastructure.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The transformation began when the Punjab Government took the
            initiative to introduce the E-Challan system in major cities like
            Lahore and Islamabad. The success of the program encouraged the
            authorities to expand it across other regions of Punjab. Following
            this success, the federal government adopted the system and extended
            its implementation to Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and
            Balochistan, bringing the entire country under a unified digital
            traffic management framework.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            With the rise of AI and automation technologies around 2025, the
            E-Challan system underwent rapid modernisation. AI-enabled cameras
            and automated number plate recognition (ANPR) systems made traffic
            monitoring more accurate and efficient.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            When the system was finally introduced in Karachi, it became a major
            headline. As Pakistan&apos;s largest and most densely populated city,
            Karachi witnessed a wave of public interest, not only because of the
            improved enforcement but also due to the humorous and unexpected
            snapshots captured by the E-Challan cameras, which quickly became
            viral on social media.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Today, the E-Challan system stands as a symbol of Pakistan&apos;s
            progress toward digital governance, transparency, and smart city
            infrastructure.
